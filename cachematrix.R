## This program calculates the inverse of a function and cache the result.
## 
## This function creates a special matrix object that can cache its inverse

makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {

}


## calculates the inverse of a special matrix returned by the above
## function or retrieve the result if it has already been calculated.

cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
        ## Return a matrix that is the inverse of 'x'
}
